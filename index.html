<h2> How do I become part of the FitMatch community? </h2>
<h3> To use FitMatch, you first need to create an User Account with your personal information. Then, you'll have the possibility to connect your account to your social media, if you have any. That will allow other users to have a clearer image of who you are! And, last but not least, do not forget to include your best profile picture!
</h3>


<h2> How does it work? </h2>

<h3> When you feel like doing sports, you can go into the "Research" section and enter your parameters: type of sport, practice level, city you're living in and the perimeter width you want. FitMatch will match your profile with other users having the same parameters as you, and it will be up to you to choose! Furthermore, once your parameters are saved, FitMatch will also show you, in the "Map" section, all the facilities corresponding to your needs near your position.
</h3>

<h2> Security </h2>
<h3> You'll be able to provide the identity and contact details of a trusted person. In addition to that, the app captures your geolocation, in case anything was to occur - unexpected injury, for example. Regarding your personal information, phone number, email, medical certificates and a few other data items will be kept strictly confidential by our services. However, picture, name, age and address will be visible by your future partners! Last but not least, at the end of each activity, FitMatch will ask for an ending confirmation and a review - that can be confidential if you want it to - to make sure everything went fine.
